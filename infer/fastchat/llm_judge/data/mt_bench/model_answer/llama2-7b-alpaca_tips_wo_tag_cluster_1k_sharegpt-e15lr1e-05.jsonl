This estimate is based on the assumption that the tree will live for 80-100 years and will photosynthesize at an average rate of 1 kg per day. To arrive at this estimate, we first need to determine the rate of photosynthesis. This can be calculated by multiplying the rate of photosynthesis per unit area and time, which is typically around 8-12 \u03bcmol/m2/s. Then, we multiply this rate by the surface area of the tree, which is typically around 20-30 m2. This gives us an estimate of around 160-240 \u03bcmol/s. Finally, we multiply this rate by the number of seconds in a day, which is 3600, to get an estimate of around 640-1000 \u03bcmol/day.

Such evidence could include sales data before and after the advertising campaign, customer surveys, and market research on consumer preferences for animal publications.

Generative AI can also help reduce the workload of teachers by automating mundane tasks such as grading and record-keeping. \n\nSocrates: That all sounds very promising.

Won't it be too expensive for many schools?\n\nBill Gates: The cost of generative AI should be considered an investment in the future of education.

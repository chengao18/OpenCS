Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon in which two quantum systems interact in such a way that the quantum states of each system become correlated, even if the systems are separated by a large distance. This means that the quantum states of the two entangled particles cannot be described independently of each other, as if they were two separate systems.

In this allegorical poem, they represent two people who are in love but whose lives are vastly different.\n\nThe Sun rises every morning, its brightness illuminating the night sky. It is powerful and unstoppable, its light bringing life and warmth to all it touches. The Moon, on the other hand, only appears in the darkness of night, its subtle glow providing light when needed most. It is mysterious and ever-changing, its presence a reminder of the beauty of the unknown.\n\nBoth the Sun and the Moon are drawn to each other, their love powerful enough to overcome any distance or difference. They understand each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and appreciate the beauty of both their presence and absence. Despite their differences, they have come to accept that they can only exist in each other\u2019s lives, their love providing the light and warmth that each one needs."]}], "tstamp": 1723620541.9233396}
